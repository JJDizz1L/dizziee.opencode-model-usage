# dizziee.opencode-model-usage

OpenCode token usage stats in the Omarchy bar. Displays today, weekly, and all-time token counts per model.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCode (official) https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode
  - Arch: `pacman -S opencode`
- OpenCode with existing session data in `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`

## Installation

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/JJDizz1L/dizziee.opencode-model-usage.git --enable
```

### Then place it in your bar layout with

`omarchy bar put dizziee.opencode-model-usage [--section <left|center|right>]`

Suggested placement:

```
omarchy bar put dizziee.opencode-model-usage --section left
```

You can validate the plugin at any time with:

```sh
omarchy plugin validate ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/dizziee.opencode-model-usage
```

## Updating

To pull the latest version of the plugin:

```sh
omarchy plugin update dizziee.opencode-model-usage --yes
```

## Configuration

Configuration lives in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The supported way to change it is:

```sh
omarchy bar set dizziee.opencode-model-usage refreshIntervalSec 900 --json
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | integer (30–3600) | 900 | How often the background scan may run (seconds) |

Numbers need `--json`, or they land in `shell.json` as strings. The panel's settings view (right-click the bar icon) writes the same value.

A background tick only starts Python when the cached snapshot is older than 90% of the interval. Opening the panel refreshes only if the snapshot is more than 30 seconds old; `r`, the Refresh button, or middle-clicking the bar icon forces a scan.

## Data and cache

The scanner opens OpenCode's SQLite database read-only and extracts only the model and token fields it needs for aggregate counts. It never copies the database, and message text is never stored or shown. The time window is index-backed and the grouping projection is materialised in memory, so a scan does not spill a temporary file to disk.

The last successful result is cached at `~/.cache/omarchy/dizziee.opencode-model-usage.json`. That file is the compact aggregate the panel draws — currently about 4 KB, hard-capped at 128 KB — never messages or a database copy. The cache lets the bar paint immediately at shell start without spawning Python, and every bar instance watches it so one scan reaches every monitor. A failed scan leaves the cache and the displayed numbers alone and starts retrying after 30 seconds, backing off to five minutes; the panel marks the numbers stale and shows the last good result.

No network access is used.

## Translations

Every UI string comes from `i18n/en.json` through `Commons.Translations`, so the panel, bar tooltip, settings view, and error states follow the language picked under **Setup → Language** without a shell restart. Counts use `Commons.I18n.formatNumber` and weekday names use the language's locale.

To add a language, copy `i18n/en.json` to `i18n/<code>.json` (for example `da.json`, `pt-BR.json`) and translate the values. Keep the keys and the `%1`/`%2` placeholders unchanged. A missing key falls back to the base language (`pt-BR` to `pt`), then to English, then to the key itself, so a partial catalog is safe. Strings that count use CLDR plural forms:

```json
"opencode.moreModels": {
  "one": "+%1 more model",
  "other": "+%1 more models"
}
```

Raw scanner diagnostics stay in English as technical detail; the surrounding status text is translated.
